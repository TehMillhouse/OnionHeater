# How do we autotune this monster?

* First: measure ENV_TEMP

* thermal mass: heat hotend from ENV_TEMP to 180 degrees, then stop, and see how much it overshoots
    problem: which parameter to tune with this? number of shells? heat conductivity?

* heater power estimation (bootstrapping?)
      First, one long burn, find peak, measure angle of climb (heater power)
      After burn: measure falloff angle
Suppose heater wattage is known
* passive Convective cooling:
      set heater to 30%, wait till it reaches equilibrium. Now, input = convective losses
* number of shells / metal heat conductivity:
   heat with a square wave, so the temp graph becomes staircase
   predict whole graph, scale it so the peaks are aligned
   choose number of shells for best fit
How do we calculate thermal egress?

Phases during autotuning:
* heatup: initial heating [env_temp up to target]
* overshoot [target until peak]
* cooldown [peak until env_temp + 20 degrees]

plus same thing again with fan turned on.
